Modularization is the practice of splitting up your code into modules
or components that have dedicated roles or responsibilities.
The most common example of modularization is the MVC framework.

Require & module.exports:
    * Require is a function that takes in a parameter. The parameter is the location of the file
        that we are requiring. Require first executes the code in the file and then passes
        back the value inside of module.exports as a return value.
    * Since we pass the dictionary variable into the module.exports, when we require it we can
        store the returned value into another variable.
