Modularization is the practice of splitting up your code into modules
or components that have dedicated roles or responsibilities.
The most common example of modularization is the MVC framework.

Require & module.exports:
    * Require is a function that takes in a parameter. The parameter is the location of the file
        that we are requiring. Require first executes the code in the file and then passes
        back the value inside of module.exports as a return value.
    * Since we pass the dictionary variable into the module.exports, when we require it we can
        store the returned value into another variable.

* server.js
    - Always start with your server.js file
    - The server.js file acts as the home base for your application.
        This is where you require the routes and the mongoose configurations
    - The server.js also creates the express application, loads configurations onto it, and then tells it to listen!

* server/config/routes.js
    - This is the file that specifies which routes will be handled and by which controller methods.
    - From routes.js we require the controller file (or files).

* server/controllers/quotes.js
    - This is the file that handles all of the server-side logic. The controller is called upon by the routes.
    - The controller interacts with preloaded models to run database commands.
    - The controller sends the response to the client.
    - There can be many controllers in the server/controllers folder.

* server/config/mongoose.js
    - This is the file that connects to the database and loads all of the models.
    - Here we specify a database to connect to and the path where all of our models are.
    - This file is required by server.js.

* server/models/quote.js
    - This is the file that specifies the schema to be loaded by mongoose.
    - This file is required by mongoose.js.
    - We do not need to require this file in the controller, instead, the model itself is loaded from mongoose.
    - There can be many models in the server/models folder.
