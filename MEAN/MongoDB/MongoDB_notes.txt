MongoDB is a NoSQL database. NoSQL stands for "Not Only SQL".
While NoSQL does support a structured query language (SQL),
there is more flexibility in the storage of the data other than
just basic tabular storage.

** In a NoSQL environment, every piece of data is unaware of the other pieces. **

!! NO JOINS !!

Everything stored in a MongoDB database is a JSON object.
