============

MongoDB is a NoSQL database. NoSQL stands for "Not Only SQL".
While NoSQL does support a structured query language (SQL),
there is more flexibility in the storage of the data other than
just basic tabular storage.

** In a NoSQL environment, every piece of data is unaware of the other pieces. **

!! NO JOINS !!

Everything stored in a MongoDB database is a JSON object.

* mongod daemon
    - A daemon is simply a program that runs in the background which manages different processes.
    - Run mongod and leave it running while we use the database
* mongo terminal

    - Access database manually to create, update, and manage your data directly
